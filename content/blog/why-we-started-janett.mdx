The science of learning is not a mystery. For over a century, cognitive scientists have been uncovering the principles that govern how humans acquire and retain knowledge. We know, with remarkable precision, what works.

**Retrieval practice** strengthens memory far more than passive review. **Spaced repetition** defeats the forgetting curve. **Interleaving** builds flexible, transferable skills. **Desirable difficulties**—challenges that slow initial learning but enhance long-term retention—are not obstacles to overcome but mechanisms to embrace.

And yet, the vast majority of learners have never heard of these principles. They highlight. They re-read. They cram. They mistake the feeling of familiarity for genuine understanding.

## The Problem We're Solving

This isn't a failure of intelligence or effort. It's a failure of systems. The tools we give learners—textbooks, videos, flashcard apps—are largely designed around convenience, not cognition. They optimize for engagement metrics rather than durable learning outcomes.

The result is a strange paradox: we have never had more access to information, yet we have never been worse at learning. The bottleneck is no longer content—it's the architecture of learning itself.

## Why Now

Artificial intelligence has fundamentally changed what's possible. For the first time, we can build systems that:

- Adapt in real time to a learner's cognitive state
- Generate infinite examples tailored to individual context
- Engage in genuine Socratic dialogue, not scripted response
- Model the full complexity of human memory and attention

But technology alone is not enough. The question is not whether AI can improve learning—it clearly can. The question is whether we will build these systems on the foundation of science, or on the quicksand of intuition.

## Our Approach

At Janett, we are building what we call the **pedagogical engine**: the orchestration layer that decides what to present, when to present it, how to sequence it, and why.

This engine must be:

1. **Grounded in biology.** Memory consolidation, neuroplasticity, cognitive load—these aren't abstractions but physical processes with real constraints and opportunities.

2. **Integrative.** The proven strategies—retrieval, spacing, interleaving, dual coding, elaboration—must work together as a unified system, not a grab-bag of techniques.

3. **Holistic.** Learning doesn't happen in isolation. Sleep, stress, motivation, beliefs about one's own capacity to grow—all of these shape the learning process and must be accounted for.

## What's Next

We are a small team, focused and deliberate. We believe that learning is the master skill—the skill that makes all other skills possible—and that improving how humans learn is among the highest-leverage problems we can solve.

We're just getting started. Follow along as we share what we learn.
